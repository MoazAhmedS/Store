# Store Management System

## Introduction

The Store Management System is a desktop application developed to address the challenges faced by store owners in managing inventory and sales. This project was initiated to assist my dad, who owns a store with a wide range of products and frequently changing prices. The system provides an intuitive interface for easy manipulation and navigation of products, allowing efficient inventory management and sales tracking.
